# Code-Challenge-1-JavaScript-and-jQuery

- [X] Create a <button> element on the DOM, you may do this in jQuery, or write it directly in the HTML code. Have the button text read "Generate".

- [X] Using jQuery, append a <div> element when you click the button.

- [X] Inside the <div> element you created in the previous step, create a <p> element that shows how many times you have clicked the button from the first step.

- [X] Inside the <div> element you created in step two, append two <button> elements. The text of the two buttons should read "Swap" and "Delete".

- [] In a CSS file, any <div> created using the "Generate" button should have a Red background-color.

- [] Clicking a "Swap" <button> should change its parent background-color from Red to Yellow.

- [] Clicking the "Swap" <button> again should turn the color back to Red.

- [] Clicking a "Delete" <button> should remove its parent <div> container (and all of its contents).
